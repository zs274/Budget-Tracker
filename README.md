# Budget Tracker
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.

## Pseudo Code
1. Install node packages
2. Read through starter files to see what is needed
3. Create service worker
4. Create manifest

Based on this my code would have to:
- Allow the user to input data offline and cache that data for use when the app comes back online
- Allow the user to add and subtract payments 

## Difficulties
The main difficulty I had again was in deploying to heroku. My code worked fine locally but threw a lot of errors when deployed, however I was able to fix them and sucessfully deploy the app. I also had some difficulties with the service worker but I think I just need to study them more.

## Overall thoughts
This homework was useful in understanding how PWAs work and I'm looking forward to making more.
